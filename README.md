# Sūrya NoteBook

Sūrya is the goddess sun who will try to protect the T-Rex from the meteorites to avoid extinction.

1 week challenge project where I had to develop from scratch a video game using Javascript.

The characters drawing, sprites, design and coding are completely made by me.

This is my first videogame ever.
